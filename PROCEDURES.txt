here are some common fields that you might consider including in an alert document:

  @timestamp: The timestamp when the alert was triggered.
  message: A descriptive message providing information about the alert.
  severity: The severity level of the alert (e.g., "high," "medium," "low").
  source: The source or origin of the alert.
  status: The current status of the alert (e.g., "open," "closed").
  host: Information about the host or system where the alert originated.
  event_type: The type or category of the alert (e.g., "security," "performance").
  additional_information: Any other relevant information or metadata associated with the alert.
  These are just examples, and you can adapt them based on your specific needs. It's important to define a mapping for your Elasticsearch index that reflects the structure of your alert documents.
